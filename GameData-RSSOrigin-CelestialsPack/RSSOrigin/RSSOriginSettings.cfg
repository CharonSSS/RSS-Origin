			// [1]: Nine likeliest dwarf planets include Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna and Orcus

		OrbitLineColor = GroupedFeatured
		// White = Pure white (1,1,1) orbit line color for every celestial added by RSS-Origin CelestialsPack, and Ceres, Vesta
		// Gray = Medium gray (0.5,0.5,0.5) orbit line color for every celestial added by RSS-Origin CelestialsPack, and Ceres, Vesta
		// DarkGray = Dark gray (0.25,0.25,0.25) orbit line color for every celestial added by RSS-Origin CelestialsPack, and Ceres, Vesta
		// GroupedBright = Characteristic orbit line color[2] (1.0R,1.0G,1.0B) for every celestial added by RSS-Origin CelestialsPack and Ceres, Vesta, Pluto, except for the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto (1,1,1)
			// [2]: The color is corresponded to "List of RSS-Origin added celestials" in https://github.com/CharonSSS/RSS-Origin
		// GroupedDark = Same as GroupedBright, but with darker color (0.5R,0.5G,0.5B), and (0.5,0.5,0.5) for the moons of J, S, U, N, P
		// GroupedDark2 = Same as GroupedBright, but with much darker color (0.25R,0.25G,0.25B), and (0.25,0.25,0.25) for the moons of J, S, U, N, P
		// GroupedFeatured = Same as GroupedDark2, but with brighter color (0.375,0.375,0.375) for the moons of J, S, U, N, P, and custom color for nine likeliest dwarf planets[1]

		UseEVECloudsJSUN = False
		// This setting is mainly for KSRSS and GGE/RVE2.0 users
		// True = EVE cloud layers will cover the kopernicus textures of the gas planets, therefore you can't see the new textures for gas planets added by RSS-Origin RSSTexture&TopoRevamp
		// False = By default. Force disable EVE cloud layers of gas planets

		//SunColor = RealisticWhite ## Awaiting to be published ##
		// RealisticWhite = By default. Realistic pure white sun and sun light color (1,1,1) capable of most cases
		// AbsolutelyRealistic = Most realistic sun and sun light color (0.954698248667947,1,0.983389436531378) using sRGB corrected sun's spectrum
		// LightWarm = Light warm tone sun color only, sun light color is pure white

		// HeavyWarm = Heavy warm tone sun color only, sun light color is pure white

		// --- This setting is for KSRSS only ---
		TrueEclipticInclinations = False
		// True = Force all moons' inclinations to relative to the ecliptic plane.
		// False = By default. All moons' inclinations are relative to their parent body's equator.
