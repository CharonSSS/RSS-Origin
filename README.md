# Note
This mod is still **work-in-progress**. The Github page is still **under construction**.

Currently the mod is in **closed-beta**, many features are **unfinished**.

**If you want to play it right now, just clone and download ZIP. But remember, this is still unfinished right now, me and my team are devoting every effort to improve it.**

**If you want to play and test it, or report bugs of it, or you have some ideas about my mod, I'm applying for a discord channel in Kopernicus server, once I've got a channel you can join the discussion.**

# About the mod

Like the title, this mod currently including the following parts:

**RSS-Origin CelestialsPack**, which adds plenty of asteroids, asteroid moons, comets, moons of gas/ice giants, dwarf planets, dwarf planet moons, and interstellar objects into the Solar System, currently 141 in total. (dozens more in the future)

(textures awaiting for upload) **RSS-Origin RSSTexture&TopoRevamp**, which overhauls some of the RSS celestials with more accurate, more realistic and higher res textures and topography, since some of the RSS textures are unrealistic in color and topo and other stuff.

**RSS-Origin JSUNrings**, which adds accurate and realistic rings to the 4 gas giants.

(textures awaiting for upload) **RSS-Origin GalaxyTex**, which replaces your skybox with a high-quality Milky Way background.

# More details about the mod (points for attention, to-dos, plans, screenshots)

**RSS-Origin CelestialsPack** is originally made for playing in Principia, now too. Many of its unique featurescan only be displayed in Principia, like irregular gravitational field of potatos, binary/trinary systems, orbital mechanics of trojans and co-orbitals, etc. **So it is highly recommended to play the mod in Principia.**

### --- Again, Principia is highly recommended to play with ---

And here is a list about all the celestials added and planning to add soon.
