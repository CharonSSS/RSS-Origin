# Important note: RSS-Origin 1.xx does **NOT** support Sol. Do **NOT** install RSS-Origin from here if you're playing with Sol. The future Sol-compatible RSS-Origin 2 is still in development. I'm excepting late February for it to be finally released.

# (WIP) _***RSS-Origin - Exclusive add-ons with hundreds of asteroids, comets, moons and overhauls for RSS***_

### Even, do you just want to replace the stock skybox background?
### Why don't you try this mod - RSS-Origin!
