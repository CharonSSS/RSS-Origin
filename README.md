# Note
This mod is still **work-in-progress**. The Github page is still **under construction**.

Currently the mod is in **closed-beta**, many features are **unfinished**.

**If you want to play it right now, just clone and download ZIP. But remember, this is still unfinished right now, me and my team are devoting every effort to improve it.**

**If you want to play and test it, or report bugs of it, or you have some ideas about my mod, I'm applying for a discord channel in Kopernicus server, once I've got a channel you can join the discussion.**

# About the mod

Like the title, **this mod needs "[Real Solar System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/177216-*)" to run properly**, and currently it includes the following parts:

- **_RSS-Origin CelestialsPack_**, which adds plenty of asteroids, asteroid moons, comets, moons of gas/ice giants, dwarf planets, dwarf planet moons, and interstellar objects into the Solar System, currently 141 in total. (dozens more in the future)

- **_RSS-Origin RSSTexture&TopoRevamp_** (textures awaiting for upload), which overhauls some of the RSS celestials with more accurate, more realistic and higher res textures and topography, since some of the RSS textures are unrealistic in color and topo and other stuff.

- **_RSS-Origin JSUNrings_**, which adds accurate and realistic rings to the 4 gas giants.

- **_RSS-Origin GalaxyTex_** (textures awaiting for upload), which replaces your skybox with a high-quality Milky Way background.

# More details about the mod (points for attention, to-dos, plans, screenshots)

- ### _RSS-Origin CelestialsPack_

**_RSS-Origin CelestialsPack_** is originally made for playing in Principia, now too. Many of its unique features can only be displayed in Principia, like irregular gravitational field of potatos, binary/trinary systems, orbital mechanics of trojans and co-orbitals, etc. **So it is highly recommended to play the mod in Principia.** You can play without Principia though, but I bet you won't get a good experience, especially conducting interplanetary missions.

### --- Again, [Principia](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/162200-*) is highly recommended to play with ---

### And please be sure to read "[Installation Guide](README.md#installation-guide)" before installation!

And here is a list about all the celestials added and planning to add soon.

- ### _RSS-Origin RSSTexture&TopoRevamp_

**_RSS-Origin RSSTexture&TopoRevamp_** is an overhaul to some of the RSS celestials. I've done a widely search for information and figure out some of the RSS celestials are using wrong surface textures and topograhy maps, so this mod's purpose is to fix those issues. Different texture resolutions are provided, 4k, 8k and 16k for now. And here is a list for all the objects been revamped. (only maximum resolution listed)

### Don't forget to read "[Installation Guide](README.md#installation-guide)" before installation!

# Installation Guide

## For _RSS-Origin CelestialsPack_

**Since this is the major part of the mod, we will give you a detailed guide and note, and we hope that you can patiently read it through**

### Things you should know:

Since this mod adds 141 extra celestial bodies to your game by default, along with 33 celestial bodies from RSS, for a total of 174, **this will cause your game to lag during acceleration and slow scene switching**. Given this situation, the folder structure of this mod is: each celestial or celestial system is placed in a separate folder, and you can add or remove celestial folders according to your own needs to ensure the smoothness of your gameplay.

We strongly **do not recommend** installing all celestials at once. (except for viewing scenery or searching for your target(s))

It is highly recommended **not to** install all celestials while you are ready to conduct interplanetary missions! We suggest retaining only the celestial(s) required for the mission and removing the remainings.

**Specific operations for adding/removing celestial bodies:**
	Go to RSSOrigin in gamedata, search for celestial folders you need or don't need.
 	Move the unwanted celestial folders out of GameData (! Please remember the location of the celestial folder before moving it out! If you forget, you can go to check "[List of added celestials](https://github.com/CharonSSS/RSS-Origin/blob/main/assets/Celestial%20bodies%20added%20in%20RSS-Origin%20up-coming%20initial%20release.png)" for the location of the celestial folder)
  	If you need a certain celestial or celestial system, you can place it back in the corresponding position within GameData/RSSOrigin.

### Dependencies and recommendations

[Real Solar System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/177216-*) and all dependencies of it (of course)

(In case you are new to KSP, dependencies of RSS are: [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-*), [Kopernicus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200143-*), [RSS-Textures](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/177216-*), [KSP Community Fixes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-*))

### !!! Important note：
#### - Check if you have "KSP Community Fixes" installed. If yes, turn the option "Maneuver Tool" off in your gameplay settings. If you don't follow this step, you "may" experience a extremely laggy gameplay once you are inflight.
#### - If you haven't install "KSP Community Fixes" yet, install it, and follow the step above. If "KSP Community Fixes" is not in your gamedata, you will be sure to experience the same issue.

2. Go to the release page of this repository, choose what celestial(s) you desired, download it.
3. Unzip **"_RSS-Origin CelestialsPack Core.zip_"**，you will find 2 folders, Principia and RSSOrigin. Put both of them into your Gamedata in the right way and overwrite the 2 cfgs of Principia. (if you are playing without Principia, just ignore the 2 cfgs)
4. Follow the step in Important note above.
5. If you are playing **without** Principia, just launch the game and continue your saves.
